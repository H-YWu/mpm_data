## MPM Data

This is part of data that I used for [this MPM simulation](https://github.com/H-YWu/mpm).

- _generateParticles_ includes data and Houdini project files for generate the material point data (in _.xyz_ format).
- _offlineRender_ includes a simple snow renderer implemented in Houdini, OpenVDB data and rendered results.
